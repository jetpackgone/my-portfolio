# My Porfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio at https://jetpackgone.com, hosted on [Netlify].

This site was created using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a site generator built on [React](https://reactjs.org/).

This site uses [Typography.js](https://github.com/kyleamathews/typography.js/) with a customized version of the [Lincoln theme](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typography.js/tree/master/packages/typography-theme-lincoln). The color palette was chosen using [Colormind](http://colormind.io/).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Install NodeJS and npm**

    Instructions for installing NodeJS can be found in many places, but here is one from Gatsby's tutorial:
