# My Porfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio at https://jetpackgone.netlify.app/.

This site is built on Gatsby and hosted on Netlify.

1. **Install NodeJS and npm**

    Instructions for installing NodeJS can be found in many places, but here is one from Gatsby's tutorial:
